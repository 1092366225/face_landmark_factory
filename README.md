# facial-landmark-factory ( Production system of facial landmark detection)

## Project Description

[facial-landmark-factory] (https://github.com/songhengyang/face_landmark_factory) is a production system of facial landmark detector written in Python, using Tensorflow r1.13 and subsequent high-level components Keras and Data. Users can use the built-in detection model of this system to process images and video data containing human faces, and conveniently implement functions such as automatic annotation of facial landmark, manual correction of landmark points, conversion of data format, and model training of facial landmark detection. Finally, it is possible to quickly generate a customized model of facial landmark detection suitable for a designated application scenario.

## Features

1. This system can automatically detect and collect the frames containing human face in videos, and automatically annotate faces using the built-in models with this production system of facial landmark detection.

2. Using the tools with this system, users can manually correct the points of facial landmark generated by the automatic annotation tool.

3. This system can convert the file format of annotation data, and generate the data that can be recognized by Tensorflow.

4. There are seven mainstream deep learning neural networks with this system. Users can train private data with these neural networks to generate the customized model of facial landmark detection suitable for designated application scenarios.

5. The user can adjust the built-in algorithm, modify these deep learning neural networks, and optimize the effect of facial landmark detection.

## Quick Start

To start the test program: 

    ./testing/test_webcam.py

To exit from the test program: 

    Press q

(Note: test_webcam.py reads the local video file vid.avi by default. If you have a camera with your PC, and want to use the camera as the input source of the test program, you need to modify the value of pamameter "VIDEO_PATH".)

Parameter Description
    
1.current_model, file of model, such as:

    current_model = "../model/facial_landmark_cnn.pb"

2.VIDEO_PATH, video file path, such as:

    VIDEO_PATH = "../data/vid.avi" 

or 

    VIDEO_PATH = 0 

(0 means using a local camera as the input source)

3.CNN_INPUT_SIZE, the height of the network input image (height and width are the same), Such as:

    CNN_INPUT_SIZE = 64

### <a name="1">Automatic annotation of video files</a>

- ./data_generate/video_auto_label.py

    This tool reads the video file, uses the built-in model of facial landmark detection with this system, recognizes faces appearing in the frames, automatically annotates face landmarks, generates a file of pts format, the files of facial image and the files of pts formatted dimension are stored in a same directory.

Parameter Description

MODEL_FILE, the file of face landmark detection model, such as：

    MODEL_FILE = "../model/facial_landmark_MobileNet.pb"

VIDEO_PATH, file of the video, such as:

    VIDEO_PATH = "../data/IU.avi"

OUTPUT_DIR, the directory storing the files of facial image and the files of pts format annotation, such as:

    OUTPUT_DIR = "../data/out"

CNN_INPUT_SIZE, input image size of neural network, height and width are the same,

    CNN_INPUT_SIZE = 64

### <a name="2">Data Preprocessing</a>

- ./data_generate/from_pts_to_json_box_image.py

    This tool reads files of annotation data in pts format, calculates the dimensions of the generated facial box, and then records the dimentions of facial box and the facial annotation data into the files of facial box dimention and the files of facial landmark in json format.

Parameter Description

INPUT_LIST, the list of directories storing pts annotation files, such as:
    
    INPUT_LIST = ["../data/out"]

OUTPUT_DIR, the directory storing files of the facial box dimentions and the files of facial landmarks in json format,

    Such as: OUTPUT_DIR = "../data/json"

- ./data_generate/manual_correct_label.py

    This tool helps the user to manually correct the postions of the face landmark. The tool reads the original image file, the face box positions file of the jason format, and the face landmark annotation file, and displays the image of the face box and the landmark that has been marked, and the user can use the keyboard to correct the positions of the landmark. The facial landmark are manually corrected, and finally the corrected face box position file and the face landmark file are generated.
    
Parameter Description

INPUT_DIR, the directory storing files of facial dimensions and the files of facial landmarks, such as:
    
    INPUT_DIR = "../data/json"

Instructions for correcting the facial landmarks with keyboard (requires activation of the window by click the right button):

    Press the space bar: next image file

    Press b: the previous image file

    Press q: the last point

    Press e: the next point

    Press a: shifts one pixel to the left

    Press d: shifts one pixel to the right

    Press the w key: moves to next pixel

    Press s: the feature point moves to last pixel

    Program exit:

    Press the Esc key

- ./data_generate/gen_argment.py

    The tool uses a limited number of face image datasets to generate augment datasets based on rules to improve model training. The tool reads the facial image file and the facial landmark detection annotation file of the specified directory, and generates an augment data set according to the built-in rules of the tool.
